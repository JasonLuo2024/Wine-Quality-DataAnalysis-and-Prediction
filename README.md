# Wine-Quality-DataAnalysis-and-Prediction
It is my personal project which was compeleted by the end of 2023.
According to the project guidelines, I was restricted to using only a linear regression model, which I implemented using PyTorch.
The project was exceptionally well-received, earning a remarkable grade of 21 out of a full mark of 20.
